    <h2>Welcome to BenLee Animal Shelter Service</h2>

    <p>Imagine a rejected dog in his or her cage, at the animal shelter just waiting for the day to come when he or she
      will be adopted, loved, and cared for. Little do they realize that it is their last day alive on earth, not
      because they are a bad dog but only because of the lack of space provided in the shelter. Each year, 3.9 million
      cats and dogs are euthanized in the United States. I truly stand on the idea that all animals deserve a second
      chance. People should adopt dogs from shelters and rescue organizations because it can not only save them money,
      but help stop overcrowding in shelters, and end the production of puppy mills.

      There are too many animals and not enough homes. Shelters have been facing a pet overpopulation problem for the
      last few decades. Many animals are found wandering around streets as strays, and some are given up by their owners
      who no longer want to, or cannot provide care for them. To help reduce pet overpopulation, it is important to have
      your pet sterilized, this is an effective method and will not cause pets to reproduce. In most shelters, spaying
      or neutering is mandatory for all adopted dogs and cats.…show more content…
      You could also be inspiring others to follow in your steps and adopt. In a puppy mill, dogs are often kept in
      cages with wire flooring that injures their legs and paws. When the female breeding dogs can no longer reproduce,
      they are often killed. Adopting will not just save the life of the pet you are adopting, but will also make a room
      and free up space for another animal who can be taken in by the shelter. This can help the shelter to continue
      doing its work and help many more animals that are in
